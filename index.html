      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog">The domestic dog</a> (Canis lupus familiaris or Canis familiaris)[4] is a member of the genus Canis (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like canids,[5] and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore.[6][7][8][9][10] The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa[11][12][13] as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated,[12][13] which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct.[14] The dog was the first species to be domesticated[13][15] and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[16]</p>
      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City">The City of New York</a>, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States.[9] With an estimated 2017 population of 8,622,698[7] distributed over a land area of about 302.6 square miles (784 km2),[10][11] New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States.[12] Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the world by urban landmass[13] and one of the world's most populous megacities,[14][15] with an estimated 20,320,876 people in its 2017 Metropolitan Statistical Area and 23,876,155 residents in its Combined Statistical Area.[4][5] A global power city,[16] New York City has been described as the cultural, financial, and media capital[17][18] of the world,[19][20][21][22][23] and exerts a significant impact upon commerce,[23] entertainment, research, technology, education, politics, tourism, and sports. The city's fast pace[24][25] defines the term New York minute.[26] Home to the headquarters of the United Nations,[27] New York is an important center for international diplomacy.[28]</p>
      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man">Pac-Man</a> (Japanese: パックマン Hepburn: Pakkuman), stylized as PAC-MAN, is an arcade game developed by Namco and first released in Japan in May 1980.[2][3] It was created by Japanese video game designer Toru Iwatani. It was licensed for distribution in the United States by Midway Games and released in October 1980. Immensely popular from its original release to the present day, Pac-Man is considered one of the classics of the medium, and an icon of 1980s popular culture.[6][7][8][9] Upon its release, the game—and, subsequently, Pac-Man derivatives—became a social phenomenon[10] that yielded high sales of merchandise and inspired a legacy in other media, such as the Pac-Man animated television series and the top-ten Buckner and Garcia hit single "Pac-Man Fever".[11] Pac-Man was popular in the 1980s and 1990s and is still played in the 2010s.</p>
